# Juncture

Juncture is a tool for creating and displaying interactive web pages.  Juncture web pages are created using an extended version of the [Markdown](Q1193600) language.  Markdown is a lightweight markup language that is widely used to add formatting elements to plain text.  Juncture extends Markdown with the addition of a few custom tags enabling interactive viewers to be easily added to a generated web page.  Juncture uses [GitHub](Q364) for storing the Markdown files.

## Getting Started

To begin using Juncture you will need a GitHub account and some basic familiarity with Markdown.

**GitHub** is a free Internet hosting service commonly used for software development projects. It provides sophisticated features for version control and workflow management for distributed teams. Juncture primarily uses GitHub as a file hosting service, similar to how one might use Dropbox or Google Drive. The Markdown files that Juncture uses to render interactive web pages are stored in GitHub.

**Markdown** is a simple language and a basic understanding of usage can be obtained in just a few minutes.  Below are some resuources for learning Markdown.

### Creating your first Juncture essay

[Example](/wb?source=juncture-digital/examples/main/sunflower/basic)

1. Create a Markdown file in your Github account.  Refer to this [simple guide to GitHub and Markdown](docs/github) for assistance, if needed.
	- Create a Github repository named `essays` if it doesn't already exist.
	- In the `essays` repository create a new file named `sunflower.md`.

2. At the top of this file add the following text.  This text will create a button enabling the rendered Juncture essay to be easily previewed (from the Chrome browser).  It is recommended that this button link be added to the beginning of the Markdown file for each Juncture essay.
	```
